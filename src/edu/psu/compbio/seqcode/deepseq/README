package:edu.psu.compbio.seqcode.deepseq

This package aims to provide a set of classes that allow you to conveniently load sequencing experiment data from ReadDB or file sources. 
Experiment relationships are kept in a tree structure that represents conditions, (controlled) replicates, and samples.
At the moment, all data is loaded into memory at initialization. While this may be efficient for many applications, we should also 
allow random access for those loaders that can support it. 

Classes in this package depend on classes in edu.psu.compbio.seqcode.gse for interacting with the database and navigating genomes. 
However, care should be taken to avoid depending on other classes (e.g. edu.psu.compbio.seqcode.projects).
