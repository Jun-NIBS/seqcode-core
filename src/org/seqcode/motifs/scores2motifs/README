This subpackage is copied from parts of the SeqUnwinder code. 

The aim is to take any scoring landscape, cluster the local peaks in that landscape based on k-mers, and then run each cluster through MEME. 
This procedure allows you to convert any arbitrary scoring landscape into interpretable motifs.
